# OpenFin Frontend Challenge

Build a React application implementing the following design:

> [Design Here]

### Acceptance Criteria

- Incorporates keyboard commands to display and dismiss the prompt
- Focuses input automatically when the prompt is displayed
- Displays list of results filtered by `title` as text is entered into the prompt
- Clicking `sort` toggles results from alphabetical order by `title` to `createdAt` (Four way toggle? :/)
- Text entered into the prompt clears each time the prompt is dismissed
- Incorporates motion animations where appropriate, e.g. on display, dismissal, searching, and sorting.
- Handles scaling and zooming gracefully using responsive principles, e.g. resizing the browser window or parent container and adjusting page zoom
- Application builds and starts with a single command
- Deliver a respository and a live instance ([Netlify](https://netlify.com) works great) when you're finished

### Guidelines

- Be prepared to spend 3-5 hours on the challenge
- Use any frameworks or libraries supporting your build and be ready to discuss your decisions

        "createdAt": "2020-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"
    },
    {
        "id": "2",
        "type": "item",
